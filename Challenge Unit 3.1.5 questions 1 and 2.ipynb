    "I would focus on the mean, for several reasons.  First, when presenting data and speaking in terms of averages (or central tendency) the mean is often considered the most commonly used measure of central tendency. Therefore, a descrition of data in terms of the mean should prove fairly accessible to most target audiences.  Given that this data set does not have any gross outliers, the mean seems a reasonable reflection of the central tendency of the data set.  Likewise, because the data set is so small, the median appears to be rather self-evident, and less data rich than the mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "I would choose to describe the standard deviation, because it presents the degree of difference between each data point in a unit of measurement that is not squared, and is therefore likely to be easier for target audienced to understand than variance, which presents the same units, only squared.  It is also easier of me the data scientist to work with the non or unsquared units.  I would also choose to work with the standard deviation, because I am only describing one set of measurements. Were I describing multiple sets of differing measurements, I would use the standard error, which describes the average mean of a set of means, and derives the standard deviation based on that value."
